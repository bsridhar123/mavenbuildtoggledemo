Demo Maven Project
==================

Using Maven Profiles to exclude main/test java source and other resources

--exclude demo service
mvn clean package -Pexclude-demo-service

--Build by excluding demo service
mvn clean package -Pexclude-mock-service

--Build by excluding config resource
mvn clean package -Pexclude-config-resource

--Build by excluding both services
mvn clean package -Pexclude-both-services


Does not work???
mvn clean package -Pexclude-demo-service,exclude-mock-service
